It is differenet from similar programs in the way you edit database data. In other similar programs user don't see and \"feel\" how data in database tables are related to each other by foreign keys and other constraints. Tangenta is based on special development platform which is very similar to CodeFirst from Microsoft. This platform was developed by Damjan Štrucl-Hrnčič in years 2010-2014. Tangenta offers you to have 1 to 3 different departments named (Shop A, Shop B, Shop C) of your store at the same time. Shop A is the simpliest one. You just write item, discount, it's price and tax (VAT).Each Item you can put on the Invoice item list or remove it from there. Shop B is working only with it's pricelsit- You can put an item to the onvoice item list only by selecting it from price list. So, before you can select items in Shop B you must first define items and their price list. Shop C is functioning as shop B with additional features: Stock control and ExpiryDate control and Waranty control of items.\r\nhttps://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3674019/12826334/d2879ed4-cb7a-11e5-9053-026d829853bf.png\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
